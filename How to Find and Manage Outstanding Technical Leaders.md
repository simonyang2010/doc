### 2. Core Principles for Recruiting Technical Leaders

#### 1. **2-2-2-2 Principle**  
When evaluating the work experience of technical personnel, it is recommended to follow the **2-2-2-2 principle**:
- **Every 2 years**, technical personnel should experience a significant leap, covering improvements in technical proficiency, project management, team leadership, and architecture design.
- A minimum of **2 years** in the same company is necessary to deeply understand the company and the role, completing a full cycle from learning to output.
- **Stable project experience** over 2 years reflects a candidate's in-depth understanding and focus in a specific field, rather than superficial involvement.
- During interviews and background checks, prioritize evaluating core projects and growth paths from the past **2 years**.

**Significance**:
- Candidates with frequent job changes often lack stability, preventing them from developing deep technical skills.
- For startups, training costs are high, so preference should be given to candidates who demonstrate stability and growth potential.

### 3. Key Evaluation Dimensions

#### 1. **Work Experience and Stability**  
- **Work Experience Requirements**:

- **Career Planning Awareness**:

**Additional Notes**:
- Startups cannot afford the cost of training newcomers, and candidates over 35 who are still primarily coding should be carefully considered.
